Release notes:
- New implementation of PersistentLayer (version 5.3.3.12), so new members implemented (named UniqueResult and ExecuteExpression).

- New specific methods named UniqueResult & ExecuteExpression, with another parameters used by Nhibernate.

- All ToIQueryable<TEntity> methods were deprecated, so now It's possible to use ExecuteExpression method in order to use LinqToNh,
  however the deprecated methods are kept in this release, but in the next one they will be removed.
  

That's All.
