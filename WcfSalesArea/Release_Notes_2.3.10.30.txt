Release notes:
- New interface named ISessionContextProvider which extends ISessionProvider

- New implementations of ISessionProvider as:
    - SessionContextProvider (implements ISessionContextProvider)
    - SessionCacheProvider (extends SessionContextProvider)

- New factory class named DaoFactoryTest, used by creating DAOs with contextual session providers.


The reason for developing SessionContextProvider is that applications doesn't need anymore to use CurrentSessionContext class for making bind and unbind operations,
because the session that needs this new implementation is supplied by an external method (delegate), which It will return a new session.

NOTA: if the session supplied by the delegate (indicated in argument of SessionContextProvider constructor) returne no new session, It will throw an exception,
because the session wiìhich be managed by this implementation will be contextual.

The SessionCacheProvider is similar to base class ( SessionContextProvider ), but It's able to cache (into local member) the session, which It could be reused on another business logic request,
and It's able to create new sessions after commit or rollback actions (It will depend of your custom parameter of constructor).



That's All.
